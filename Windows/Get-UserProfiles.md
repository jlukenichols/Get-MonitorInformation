# Get-UserProfiles
This function will let you show all of the user profiles that are stored on a local or remote computer, you can also delete one specific user profile or all of them.  
If you use this script against a remote computer make sure you have enabled WinRM, I made a guide for how to enable it with GPO [here](https://stolpe.io/enable-winrm-with-gpo/)
### This script will do the following
- Show all of the local user profiles
- Show all of the user profiles from a remote computer
- Delete one specific user profile or all of the user profiles from a local computer
- Delete one specific user profile or all of the user profiles from a remote computer
- Delete all user profiles from both local and remote computer
- You can exclude user profiles to show
- You can exclude user profile to be deleted
- If the user profile are loaded it will not get deleted
