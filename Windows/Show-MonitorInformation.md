# Show-MonitorInformation
This function will return information about the monitor from either local or remote computer.  
If you use this script against a remote computer make sure you have enabled WinRM, I made a guide for how to enable it with GPO [here](https://stolpe.io/enable-winrm-with-gpo/)  
### This script will return the following information
- Is the monitor active? (connected)
- Manufacturer Name
- Model
- Serial Number
- Year Of Manufacture
- Week Of Manufacture
